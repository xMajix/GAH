          "text1": "<TextStyle.Orange>Hey all!!</>\n\n<TextStyle.Blue>For those of you that are new or returning welcome(back) to Games Against Humanity Ark server we truly hope you find a comfortable, safe home to play the game we all have a love/hate relationship with. As of January 2024 we'll have been up and running for the better part of 8 years!! It's been a long fun road that I look forward to perpetuating here in the New Year and beyond.</>\n\n* <TextStyle.Green>With that in mind I wanted to remind everyone of what GAH is all about.\nWe're PVE through and through. So please don't see this as a competition against other players or tribes. I encourage everyone to (re)read the server & Community rules.  https://discord.com/channels/275780404475330560/637534780342272011</>\n\n* I do encourage players to help each other both new and old players alike. This not only helps build our community but it's hard evidence that everyone is welcome here. Please do not force or guilt-trip anyone into playing a specific way.\n\n* Play the way that's best and most relaxing to YOU. Live and let live.\n\nWe very much adhere to the first-come-first-serve rule of discovery. Trust, me there's enough to go around.\n\n* Lastly please allows the Admin team some grace, none of us get paid to run this and I promise you, it's not easy. Also, DO NOT BE AFRAID TO PING <TextStyle.Violet>@Ark Admins</> when/if needed, but also please check the global chat to see if a problem has already been announced.  We all have families and jobs that take precedence.  I promise you that we'll address issues as quickly as possible.\n\n\nA few rules I wanted to mention here:\n\n-1.1. Treat all members with respect.\n-1.2 Harassment, racist, homophobic, screen names, hate speech or any kind of discriminatory speech, images or abuse, will NOT be tolerated.\n-1.3. Racial or offensive slurs will not be tolerated.\n\n-2.3. No Stealing or ninja looting from others. Beacons & Rare Tames are first come (see it), first serve. Same goes all special event drops.\n‼ **It helps others to announce in global chat when you’ve sighted a rare tame.** ⬅ I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH‼ \n\n**Violations of our rules will result in permeant ban from all GAH games/community**. I as owner have final say, but I listen to the counsel of my entire Admin team on all matters.  I will listen to both sides of any and all arguments before coming to a decision. That said, I trust all my admin staff to do the same. We're all reasonable adults.\n\nPlease, have fun and as always DON'T DIE!!!!\n\n~Nails; GAH Co-Founder/Owner",

          "text1": "Greetings everyone, I am the event coordinator of the GAH cluster for ark. Now for those of you who are new to this community’s event think of it as more a campaign that takes place over multiple weeks giving more of a mid and end game goal to the ark server. It’s akin to ark being the solid foundation and this is a house the is built upon that foundation, like a mod. The event itself will have very minor changes to the server and its normal play style you are used to seeing so if you’re not interested all you will see is a few new buildings around the map and people doing foolish things on smaller dinos. I also act as a Dungeons Master of sorts during the event and its activities which range from throwing dinos at the participants to making them make hard choices that will affect things. Smaller one-off events will also happen throughout this longer campaign so that the whole server community can participate in and reap the benefits of this group.\nThe goal of this event is to tell a different story on how to achieve the goal of the island (ascension) and hopefully give lasting memories of the time spent doing it. If for any reason you have questions or concerns about the events or the long campaign, please reach out to me and I will get back to you as soon as a can.\n\n========The Aspects of the Event========\n\nThis event will have a passive and active type.\nThe active type is the adventures which will be launched for the event center (The enclave stronghold) and will use the small dinos to achieve things out on the island or solve problems found.\nThe passive type will deal with tasks that will be in the ⁠island-event-info channel and deals with things that the community can contribute to and which cause things to happen like a dino wipe to help with locating new dinos for the event or for the normal progress track of the island. Discord threads may also be opened connected to the ⁠island-story-event-chat to help deal with tasks as well. For those unfamiliar with threads, you can’t see them unless you look for them or invited to them, this helps reduce clutter on the discord and organizing things for participants.\n\n========The Goal=========\n\nThe goal of this event is to tell a different story on a group ascending, one that uses smaller dinos and help from others to achieve this goal and move to the next ark in line. It also will be a way for one to acquire things in different ways, make no mistake it will still take work but if your tired of grinding for metal other options will open up based on the campaign’s choices that you may as a community member decide to participate in.\n\n=======The Dino Classifications that are allowed in the event===========\n\n**See Discord for PDF Links**\n\n=======Saddle Durability System========\n\nStarting Saddle Threshold: 80\nSaddle Threshold Limit: 120\nStart Saddle Proficiency Stat: 0\nSuccess chance of deflecting attack: 16 or higher\nSmall Dino Saddle Proficiency Stat: +4",
