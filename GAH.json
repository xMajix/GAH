          "text1": "<TextStyle.Orange>Hey all!!</>\n\n<TextStyle.Green>For those of you that are new or returning welcome(back) to Games Against Humanity Ark server we truly hope you find a comfortable, safe home to play the game we all have a love/hate relationship with. As of January 2024 we'll have been up and running for the better part of 8 years!! It's been a long fun road that I look forward to perpetuating here in the New Year and beyond.</>\n\n<TextStyle.Green>*With that in mind I wanted to remind everyone of what GAH is all about.</>\n<TextStyle.Green>We're PVE through and through. So please don't see this as a competition against other players or tribes. I encourage everyone to (re)read the server & Community rules.  https://discord.com/channels/275780404475330560/637534780342272011</>\n\n<TextStyle.Green>* I do encourage players to help each other both new and old players alike. This not only helps build our community but it's hard evidence that everyone is welcome here. Please do not force or guilt-trip anyone into playing a specific way.</>\n\n<TextStyle.Green>* Play the way that's best and most relaxing to YOU. Live and let live.</>\n\n<TextStyle.Green>We very much adhere to the first-come-first-serve rule of discovery. Trust, me there's enough to go around.</>\n\n<TextStyle.Green>* Lastly please allows the Admin team some grace, none of us get paid to run this and I promise you, it's not easy. Also, DO NOT BE AFRAID TO PING</> <TextStyle.Violet>@Ark Admins</> <TextStyle.Green>when/if needed, but also please check the global chat to see if a problem has already been announced.  We all have families and jobs that take precedence.  I promise you that we'll address issues as quickly as possible.</>\n\n\n<TextStyle.Green>A few rules I wanted to mention here:</>\n\n<TextStyle.Green>-1.1. Treat all members with respect.</>\n<TextStyle.Green>-1.2 Harassment, racist, homophobic, screen names, hate speech or any kind of discriminatory speech, images or abuse, will NOT be tolerated.</>\n<TextStyle.Green>-1.3. Racial or offensive slurs will not be tolerated.</>\n\n<TextStyle.Green>-2.3. No Stealing or ninja looting from others. Beacons & Rare Tames are first come (see it), first serve. Same goes all special event drops.</>\n\n<TextStyle.Green>**Violations of our rules will result in permeant ban from all GAH games/community**. I as owner have final say, but I listen to the counsel of my entire Admin team on all matters.  I will listen to both sides of any and all arguments before coming to a decision. That said, I trust all my admin staff to do the same. We're all reasonable adults.</>\n\n<TextStyle.Green>Please, have fun and as always DON'T DIE!!!!</>\n\n<TextStyle.Orange>~Nails; GAH Co-Founder/Owner</>",

It also will be a way for one to acquire things in different ways, make no mistake it will still take work but if your tired of grinding for metal other options will open up based on the campaign’s choices that you may as a community member decide to participate in.\n\n=======The Dino Classifications that are allowed in the event===========\n\n**See Discord for PDF Links**\n\n=======Saddle Durability System========\n\nStarting Saddle Threshold: 80\nSaddle Threshold Limit: 120\nStart Saddle Proficiency Stat: 0\nSuccess chance of deflecting attack: 16 or higher\nSmall Dino Saddle Proficiency Stat: +4",
